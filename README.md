Not all functions are great to use, this library serves more an educational purpose than anything production-ready.

## Algorithms

List of included algorithms:

- `Math.random()` wrapper
- MSM
- LCG
- Xor Shift

## Planned next

- Discover new algorithms
- Fix JSDoc comments on build
- Add a util to compare the algorithms
